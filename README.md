# OOP-Todo-App-Example
A Todo App of Exemplary OOP

Authors: James Ladd (@jamesladd) and Peter DiSalvo (@thesecretsquad)

# Purpose
This project documents the process of building a simple (but not too simple) application using exemplary object-oriented design. Exemplary, meaning a developer should be able to read the Domain/Business Logic and almost reconstruct the User Story/Requirement from it.

This project is less about *what* we are building and more about *how* we build it. We intend to reveal the thought process behind testing and designing an object model, as well as other decisions made during development. We are using a Todo application because the domain is simple and recognizable, and lets us freely experiment with general questions about how to test, create a domain-rich object model, and cleanly integrate it with delivery mechanisms (user interfaces, storage mechanisms, etc.)

# Starter Story
> Talking to your users in order to flush out a story is not a simple matter of gathering requirements. What you are actually doing is building a shared understanding of the problem that youâ€™re trying to solve. You are collaborating in order to jointly decide on the best solution.

The following is our first conversation in developing a user story. In our case, we are playing the roles of developer and user.

***Initial Story***
```
As a person with things to be done
I want to manage those things
so they get done
```

## Questioning the Story and Playing the "5 whys" Game
Here, we ask questions about the story to explore and extract important meaning from the story. Questions include "what" something means or playing the "5 whys" game, where we iteratively ask the question "why?"

**Q. Why do you want to manage things?**

**Q. What does 'done' mean?**

The word 'done' has multiple meanings. So we quote it as a Domain term.

***Refined Story 1***
```
As a person with things to be 'done'
I want to track and organise those things
so they get 'done' in priority order.
```

Playing the 5 whys game...

**Q. Why do you want to track them?**

***Refined Story 2***
```
As a person with things to be 'done'
I want to know what thing to do next
so they get 'done' in priority order.
```

Playing the 5 whys game...

**Q. Why do you want it ordered by priority?**

The word 'priority' has meaning. So we quote it as a Domain term.

***Refined Story 3***
```
As a person with things to be 'done'
I want to know what thing to do next
so they get 'done' in 'priority' order.
```

Playing the 5 whys game...

**Q. Why do you say 'they' get done?**

***Refined Story 4***
```
As a person with things to be 'done'
I want to know what thing to do next
so things get 'done' in 'priority' order.
```

Playing the 5 whys game...

**Q. Why do you say 'thing'/'things' as opposed to 'task'/'tasks'?**

**A. 'Thing'/'Things' is conversational, we don't say to people, "I have tasks to do". Some phrases we might say are, for example, "I have stuff/things to do" or "I have something on".**

The word 'thing' has meaning. So we quote it as a Domain term. The word 'thing' is an alias for 'stuff' or 'task'.

***Refined Story 5***
```
As a person with 'things' to be 'done'
I want to know what 'thing' to do next
so 'things' get 'done' in 'priority' order.
```
